# Anomaly-Detection
Detecting anomalies in time-series, tabular, or sequential data using the power of Transformers and reconstruction-based learning.
# Thesis Description
Detecting anomalies in human motion from skeleton data using reconstruction-based autoencoders. This project implements and compares multiple models, with a focus on a Transformer-based Autoencoder for unsupervised anomaly detection. Other baselines include LSTM, CNN, and a standard MLP autoencoder.
Ideal for applications in surveillance, healthcare monitoring, fall detection, and activity recognition using time-series skeleton data (e.g., from Kinect or pose estimation models).
